        <p>Think of computing as accomplishing tasks with, benefiting from, or creating computers. Everyday actions like swiping a debit card,
             sending emails, or using a cell phone fall under this umbrella. The crucial aspect is the reliance on computers to process information
              and meet specific goals. It extends beyond merely using computers to also involve contributing to their ongoing development and enhancement.</p>
        <img src="pic\topic2.png">
        <p>The passage underscores the omnipresence of computers in modern life, spanning various sectors. It anticipates a growing array of career
             opportunities in computer-related fields due to increasing technological integration. The delineated categories include programming, 
             information systems management, telecommunications, research, graphics, web development, and training. This showcases the diverse avenues
              open to individuals with computer-related qualifications.</p>
        <img src="pic\topic3.png">
        <p>The Information Processing Cycle is like a step-by-step guide for dealing with information. It starts by gathering and checking data (input),
             then goes on to make sense of it through calculations or analysis (processing). After that, the important stuff is saved for later use (storage),
              and finally, we get something useful out of it, like reports or interactive insights (output). It's basically how our computers and systems handle 
              information in a structured way..

        <p> A computer system is a structured collaboration between different components, like the brain and body working together.
             The entities are like the parts of the system, such as muscles and nerves, processes are the actions performed, akin to thinking or moving, and operations
              are the specific tasks accomplished, like solving a problem or completing a project. The electronic device, the computer, is the brain of this system, 
              processing information and executing commands, much like our brains process thoughts and direct actions. In simpler terms, a computer system is like a 
              digital orchestra where different elements harmonize to perform tasks efficiently.

        <p> Computer security is like setting up digital locks and alarms to protect our information and keep it safe. 
            We ensure that only the right people have access (authentication) and decide what they can do with it (authorization). 
            It's also important to regularly check for any signs of trouble and have a plan in case something goes wrong (incident response).
             Teaching everyone about good security practices, like using strong passwords, is crucial to creating a secure digital environment (security policies and education)..

        <p>this lesson is where i struggle because HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage, giving it structure with elements like paragraphs, headings, and images. CSS is the artist,
             adding style and color to make it visually appealing. You use HTML to organize your content, like creating lists or adding links. With CSS, 
             you can decide how everything looks, from the background color to the spacing between elements, making your webpage uniquely yours.</p>
